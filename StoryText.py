r1t1str = '''You find yourself en route to the business district of the largest city
in Montana, Billings. In what looks to be a Lamborghini, a small bespectacled man
wearing a suit is speeding through these empty country roads at an average speed
of what looks like 100+ mph. He chuckles. "Relax" he says, "You shouldn't consider
this a kidnapping. I promise it's in the best interest of everybody. We need you
for your skills and expertise." From the backseat you see a deer walk out into the
middle of the road up ahead. "Watch out" you tell him, pointing up ahead. "Listen"
he says, "if you aren't going to relax, we're going to have problems." The car
hits the deer at a speed of about 150 miles per hour, launching it flying
straight into the air -- so much so that you couldn't see its fate on account of
it becoming too small. "Drink this" he says, "It'll help you relax". He hands you
an unopened bottle of Poland Spring water.'''

r2t1str = '''With your eyes glued to the window, you gradually notice the setting
change from rolling hills to homely neighborhood, and school district to company
park. "So are you going to tell me what possible expertise from a lowly
paleontologist is important enough to Warrant a kidnapping?" you ask. "Please.
Your questions will be better answered in the presence of Dr. Hojo" he replies.
"We're only a few minutes from the lab."'''

r2t2str = '''In one quick motion, you unbuckle your seatbelt, open the car door,
and a launch yourself from the fast moving vehicle. You successfully erase your
impact and manage to protect your head while skidding across pavement.
Miraculously, you seem to be unharmed. However, upon standing, a meteors comes
down from the sky and kills you.

THE END'''

r3t1str = '''"Does all this have anything to do with the recent alien
sighting?" you ask. He remained silent for a few seconds. "Looks like I found a
sore spot. I guess it must, given your silence." "FIRMWARE UPDATE REQUIRED" he
suddenly screamed. A few seconds of silent confusion filled the car. "Oh, sorry
about that. Been feeling a little under the weather recently. Also haven't been
sleeping great." Suddenly you feel more unsafe than usual and decide to stay
silent for the rest of the ride. '''

r4t1str = '''After persevering through the thickening traffic, your car slows
down after reaching an intersection between four skyscrapers: A Merrill Lynch
building, an Aetna building, a Citigroup building and a Boeing building. "Wow,
looks like the big dogs want something with me". However your silent driver
drives a little further and pulls into a McDonald's. There's exactly one free
parking space with the sign "Reserved for Electrics". "It's Monopoly month"
says your Captor. "I already have Park Place. Want anything?". "No" you reply.
"Good." He pushes a button on his cell phone, and suddenly the parking space
begins lowering underground. Shocked, you look around as you are quickly being
lowered into a large hangar. "What is this?" you ask. "Are you familiar with
the Illuminati?". "Not really, other than YouTube." The car finally reaches the
floor of this vast place and you get out. "Follow me" he says.'''

r4p5t1str = ''' "What is your name?" You ask your companion while he leads you
towards a small office on the side of this vast place. "Michael. Michael
Humanman. We're here. Let me introduce to you, Dr. Hojo." michael opens the
door, and suddenly you are launched backwards from surprise, as if you had
been shoved. The now open door revealed a human-sized bug-eyed alien with green
skin, wearing a cardigan and slacks. "Now now, don't be too surprised" the alien
said in a crackly voice. "Surely you've heard about us on the news." still on
the ground, you are too confused to answer. " make this quick." he continued,
"we've been keeping an eye on your people for a long time now, and have
identified a clear Danger to your existence. A contagion known as Super Scary
Plague, or S.S.P., has already turned a significant portion of your people into
zombies. If we don't act fast, you may be wiped out." gathering yourself, you
get up. " so what does this have to do with me?" Dr. Hojo paused for a moment,
then headed back into his office. "Come." he says.'''

r4p75t1str = '''"Catch" Dr. Hojo says. The modestly dressed bug-alien tosses you
what looks to be a femur bone. "It's porosity indicates S.S.P. infection. It
was owned by an Aztec Merchant in the 13th century." You look the bone over,
wondering how a bone from 700 years ago hasn't turned to dust yet. By sight,
the bone looks normal. "Somehow, the Aztec contracted the disease, but didn't
allow it to spread to the rest of the planet. We need to figure out how the
pathogen originated, and how they controlled it." Finally thinking you
understand the situation, you add "Well, that's very interesting. When I get
back to the university I will have to pull some books on that." Dr.Hojo pauses,
then snickers. '''

r5t1str = '''"You don't understand." says the cardigan wearing alien. "You're
going there and figuring it all out for us." Confused, you reply with "What
good would a few more fossilized bodies be? Mexico City is thousands of miles
from here anyway." Dr. Hojo, ignoring what you said, retrieved 3 flasks out of
his desk. One contained a red liquid, one contained a blue liquid and one
contained a green liquid. "Again. you don't understand. You're _going_ there."
He placed the three potions on his desk. "The red one will take you to 1372
Tenochtitlan -- where the spread must have just started. The blue one to 1428
Texcoco, in the middle of the outbreak. And the green will take you to 1521
Tzintzuntzan, where --" "the Spaniards returned with gold to Hernan Cortes,
indicating the fall of the Aztec empire."  you replied. "Seems we really do
have the right man for the job. Now, you will not leave here without drinking
one of the potions, which will wear off in exactly 48 hours, so you had better
pick the one you think might give you the most insight into S.S.P."'''

r6t1str = '''A sip of the red potion causes the room to start spinning.
Dizziness forces you to drop to your hands and knees. However, the ground
beneath you has turned to a type of light clay. Suddenly, someone carrying a
basket of food trips over your grounded body. Fruit flies everywhere. "Quipiaz
huehuetlactl! Tecocoliliztli!" exclaims the man as he picks up the fruit. You
realize you are in the middle of a bustling marketplace. It is excruciatingly
hot. "Don't sweat it" someone says behind you. It's Michael. "Here, take this."
He shoves what appears to be a fish into your ear. The man picking up fruit
suddenly is swearing at you in perfect English. You get to your feet and decide
to explore with Michael for a few minutes. There must be a thousand people in
this place exchanging goods. A very large man with a wheelbarrow full of
produce nearly knocks you over. He is coughing vigorously.'''

r6t2str = '''A sip of the blue potion causes the room to start spinning. You
drop to your hands and knees from dizziness. Things start to go dark. Thinking
you were passing out, you fully lay down on your stomach with your eyes closed.
"Intetlapaloaya" you hear. You open your eyes. It seems that things have gotten
dark because you have been teleported to some underground canal system, not
because of your feeling faint.
"Tlamahuiztiliani!" says a man holding a torch looking down at you. Michael
seems to be next to him, arguing. "Motlazatiuh, nechihua!" The man backs off.
"Oh, you're conscious" Michael says, "Here, this might help." He shoves what
appears to be a fish into your ear. The agitated man now is understandable.
"You must leave this place, magic men! The infected one is coming! Follow me
if you want to live!" He takes off down the canal.'''

r6t3str = '''A sip of the green potion causes the room to start spinning. You
drop to your hands and knees from dizziness. Before you know it, the carpeted
room of Dr. Hojo's office turns into a dusty type of sand. You pick some up and
let it slip through your fingers to prove it is real. "Quihuilana! Quihuilana!"
someone shouts. You look up to see that you have been teleported to the inside
of some hut. You seem to be behind a large basket of some kind, out of sight.
"Huellacaconemi" a voice replies from behind you. It is Michael. "Here, take
this." He shoves what appears to be a fish into your ear. "This man! He is a
magic user! One second I am peacefully enjoying my lunch, and the next a portal
opens up and this man comes out!" "I come in peace sir, please calm down."
replies Michael. Four large men walk into the hut and grab Michael. "Please!
Allow me to explain!" Michael shouts, as he is dragged off by the men.'''

r6t4str = '''You pick up the red potion slowly, bring it to your lips, and
pause. Michael is not fully blocking the exit. In one quick motion, you throw
the red potion at him and dash for the exit. You make it out with the both of
them chasing you. Next to the office is a staircase which seems to lead to the
surface. At full clip, you bolt up the stairs with both the cardigan wearing
alien and the human screaming and chasing after you. You reach the top and bust
through the door. You find yourself inside the McDonald's you previously parked
at. "This has all been a lie! It's not Monopoly week!" Just then a meteor comes
down and kills everybody.

THE END.'''

r7t1str = '''You follow the coughing man through the thick crowd as best you
can. "Wait!" you say, allowing the fish in your ear to translate. Still
coughing, the man stops and turns around. "Yes? Do you want some lettuce?"
Panting, you manage to squeak out: "Sir. *wheeze*, have you ever heard of
S.S.P.?" The man nearly falls over when you say 'S.S.P'. Still coughing, the
man turns around a starts running. This time in a sprint. Michael finally
catches up to you. "Want me to carry you? I'm very fast if I want to be."'''

r7t2str = '''"Hey you!" A group of large men approach you and Michael. "Someone
just reported that you have come out of a portal. Prove that you aren't part of
the robot men." You look at Michael, confused. "Come on now, we're just normal
dudes!" A man holds a large magnet to Michael's head, which prompts him to
start screaming "FIRMWARE UPDATE REQUIRED!" repeatedly. Removal of the magnet
continued his small talk. "Take them away" said the leader. You both are taken
to a magic cell that negates the effects of the time traveling potion. You
spend the rest of your days playing chess against each other. He wins every
game.

THE END.'''

r7t3str = '''You and Michael head back to face the 'infected man'. Michael produces
a flashlight from his pocket to light the place up. Some ominous footsteps get
louder and louder as something approaches you. The hair on your neck stands up
straight. Suddenly out from a corner comes a man who looks strikingly like
Michael. "Michael!" Michael says to the man. "Michael! What a pleasant
surprise! Don't touch me, I have S.S.P." "No Kidding!" Michael says. This new
Michael pats you on the shoulder. You recoil with fear that you have just
contracted the plague. "Hey! Don't worry, man, it only will affect us."
Relieved, you return to your relaxed state. "You're sure I can't contract it?"
Michael and Michael #2 look at each other and laugh. "Yeah... pretty sure."
You don't get it. "Come now, let's have some oil. Or tea, if you prefer."'''

r7t4str = '''You follow the man with the torch down the canal, trying to keep up with
 the light source from ahead. You hear a loud snap come from behind you.
 "Ouch!" exclaims Michael, who seems to have tripped. You hear the man up ahead
 give out a faint "Hurry!" as the light source is beginning to dim due to its
 distance.'''

r7t5str = '''Michael is carted off by the men, and you wait until his cursing
at you is out of earshot. Finally, you get out from behind the basket. The man
who had continued his lunch stand up, surprised and staring at you, but doesn't
say anything. "Listen, I -- " Just then the hut is hit by a meteor.

THE END.'''

r7t6str = '''"Wait!" you pop out from behind your hiding spot. "This man has
done nothing wrong. He is my friend. We are here to investigate the strange
disease outbreak." One of the men snickers. "Man?" he replies. He takes out a
large hunting knife from his belt. "Hold his arm out". The men restraining
Michael hold his right arm out.'''

r8t1str = '''You hop on Michael's back and tell him to follow the man running
with a wheelbarrow full of lettuce. Michael was not kidding about his speed.
You catch up to the man with ease, accidentally crashing into him. All his
lettuce goes flying, making a scene in the center of the marketplace. "Help!
I'm being chased by robots! Arrest these robots!" Five large men surround you
and Michael, take you off to a magic prison cell that negates the potions
effects, and you spend your days playing chess against he other.

THE END.'''

r8t2str = '''"Let's not make a scene." you say to Michael. "We should lay low
until we figure out how this place operates a bit." "Listen." Michael says,
"This S.S.P. It's not exactly what you think it is. It's actually a computer
virus. Not a human pathogen." A long awkward pause ensues. "What? Then why are
we back in the 14th century Aztec Empire?" "Because that's where the S.S.P.
originated." Confused to the point of a headache, you decide to sit down in the
middle of the street. "But that bone that Dr. Hojo showed me." "It was a lie.
Forget about it. Come on. Let's get some spirulina. Or would you prefer some
michihuauhtli"'''

r8t4str = '''You and the Michaels head down a dark corridor in this canal
system, listening to them engage in a very odd small talk. "Right here" Michael
#2 says, and opens a door for you and Michael #1. You all sit down at a table
and Michael #2 pours you some tea, and Michael #1 some strange, viscous liquid.
"Now then. What is it that brings you here?" Michael #2 asks. "We need to find
the origins of S.S.P. so that we can combat it in the future." "Ahh" Michael
#2 continues, "Yes of course. Well then, here you go." He begins handing you
a USB stick produced from his shirt pocket. "Actually, wait a second" Michael
#2 says. "Michael, have you told him?" "No, but maybe he figured it out by
now." After a pause, Michael #2 asks, "What is it you think we are, my good
sir? Alien, robot or human?"'''

r8t5str = '''As best as you can see in the dim light, you make your way
backwards to Michael. He produces a small flashlight from his pocket and turns
it on. "Help me up" he says. You obey. "Are you alright?" "Yes, thank you. You
don't want to get separated from me. Trust me. Now, should we follow that
paranoid man, or head back towards what he was afraid of?"'''

r8t6str = '''You try to keep up with the man with the torch as he is running
through forks in the canal that you would not be able to navigate without his
light. Finally you reach what seems to be a bunker. The man with the torch has
closed the door before you got there. "Let me in!" you shout and bang on the
door. After a long pause someone from inside the bunker says "Did you vote for
Ctlinigonoraliti in the recent special election?"'''

r8t7str = '''You kick the man holding the knife in the shin, and attempt to
pull Michael away from the other men. The plan goes horribly wrong since they
are all 6'4'' 250. You are carted off to a special prison cell that negates the
potion effects, where you live the rest of your days playing chess against
yourself. You lose every game.

THE END.'''

r8t8str = '''The leader raises his knife to Michael's arm. Then he puts that
away, puts on the proper ESD grounding strap, takes out a screwdriver, and
undoes some screws from behind Michael's shoulder. The arm disconnects safely.
"See? Robot! Take them away!" Too shocked to protest, you are taken to a magic
prison cell where the potion's effects are negated. You are stuck playing chess
with Michael for the rest of your days. You lose every game.

THE END.'''

r9t3str = '''"I don't know whether to be flattered or insulted. You want to see an
alien, though? Marcia, come out here." Suddenly a bug-eyed alien similar to Dr.
Hojo comes into the room. "Marcia, could you please teach this person the
difference between a robot and an alien?" The alien seems to comply. "Follow me"
the alien says in a very alieny voice. You follow her back through the door she
came out of, through a few canals and up to the surface. You seem to be in the
middle of a huge alien city. The buildings look like they are alive themselves.
"Look up" she says. A huge UFO is hovering overhead. It blasts a large light
down on to the both of you, and beams you up. Next thing you know you are
inside an alien spacecraft. She brings a chessboard over to you. "We're going
to show you our home planet. So let's kill some time." "How long will this
take?" you ask. "Oh, just over 600 years. And your potion won't work anymore,
by the way. You lose every game.

THE END.'''

r9t1str = '''"Hah! Nice try zombie!" the bunker tells you. You give up hope and
sit in the dark, waiting for your fate. Suddenly, you see Michael come out from
around the corner with a flashlight. "Michael! You're no zombie!" "That's true!"
he says. "Would you like some tea?" "You bet I would!" you reply. The tea tastes
exactly like the potion you had earlier. You feel yourself moving back in
time! "You're... not... Michael..." you manage to get out before being sucked
into the portal.'''

r9t2str = '''"Hah! Nice try zombie!" the bunker tells you. You give up hope and
sit in the dark, waiting for your fate. Suddenly, you see Michael come out from

r9t4str = '''"Well done. I think you have earned this." He hands you a USB
drive. "That should contain all the data you are looking for. Give my regards
to Dr. Hojo.

YOU WIN!'''

r9t5str = '''"Can a human do this?" Michael #2 undoes some screws hidden under
 the skin around his neck and completely removes his head. His head continues
 speaking: "Now let's see you try." An alien walks in the room. "We'll take him.
 It'll be good for our studies." the alien says. "Very well. It's been fun Mr.
 Human." You follow the alien through a bunch of corridors, eventually to the
 surface. A UFO beams you up, and the alien challenges you to a 100000000 game
 match of chess. You lose every game.

THE END.'''

r9t6str = '''"The spirulina is good, but unfortunately a meteor comes down and
kills you.
